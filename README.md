### using the programs available here
Basically you just have to download a precompiled (usable for noobs) program for your operating system (I promise they aren't dangerous), or if you're capable, compile the source code for it (dependencies and notes for the programs can be found below the instructions for using them).

Then you can run it. On Mac/Linux, use './<program name>'. On Windows it's the same, but you really only need to type the name of the program on Windows. After you type the command, press enter. If you can't figure out how to use them from the examples, all the programs will print a help message in the event of invalid usage (at least I hope they will). They also print a help message if you use the `-h` or `--help` options with them for the most part.
