### how to use the spam generator (spam.exe and related)
Compile the code in spam.c (if you're an epic hacker person) or download spam.exe, spam-osx, or spam-linux. It's a command line program so you run it in cmd.exe or Terminal, or, if you're on Linux, some kind of shell (i.e. bash, zsh, etc). If you're on Mac/Linux, invoke it with `./spam-osx` or `./spam-linux`. On Windows, its' just `spam`. Here's some more detailed examples:

Windows:
```batch
; put the message 'asdf' in file.txt 10 times
spam asdf 10 file.txt
; you could also do it like this if you don't want it in a file
spam asdf 10
```

It's more or less the same for other OSes (Mac/Linux)
