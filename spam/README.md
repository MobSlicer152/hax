### how to use the spam generator (spam.c)
Windows:
```batch
; put the message 'asdf' in file.txt 10 times
spam asdf 10 file.txt
; you could also do it like this if you don't want it in a file
spam asdf 10
```

Dependencies: the standard library
Notes: The percentage indicator can be super messed up in some terminals, but there's no good fix that I could find
